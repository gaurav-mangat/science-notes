            <h2 class="section-title"> What Is a Force?</h2>
            
            <p>Let us try to experience the push and the pull by thinking about how we move objects in our daily life. When we want to move a large cardboard box, we can move it in different ways - we can push it, pull it, lift it, or carry it.</p>

            <div class="image-placeholder">

            </div>

            <p>In all the ways that we might use to move the box, we have to apply a <strong>push or pull</strong> to the box. This brings us to our fundamental understanding of force:</p>

            <div class="definition-box">
                <strong>Force:</strong> Generally, the push or pull applied on an object is called force in science.
            </div>


            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Common Examples of Forces in Daily Life:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Opening a drawer:</strong> We apply a pulling force</li>
                    <li><strong>Kicking a football:</strong> We apply a pushing force with our foot</li>
                    <li><strong>Stretching a rubber band:</strong> We apply pulling forces at both ends</li>
                    <li><strong>Rolling chapati:</strong> We apply pushing force with a rolling pin</li>
                    <li><strong>Turning steering handle:</strong> We apply pushing/pulling forces to change direction</li>
                    <li><strong>Writing with a pen:</strong> We apply pushing force on paper</li>
                    <li><strong>Lifting a school bag:</strong> We apply upward pulling force</li>

            <h2 class="section-title">5.3 Are Forces an Interaction Between Two or More Objects?</h2>

            <p>To understand the nature of forces better, let's think about what happens when we apply force. When you push a table, your hand is one object applying force on another object — the table. Here, we say that your hand and the table are two objects interacting with each other.</p>

            <p>If we think carefully about all the examples we discussed earlier, we will notice an important pattern. In every case, there are always at least two objects involved. Forces don't exist in isolation - they always result from the interaction between objects.</p>

            <div class="important-note">
                <strong>Key Observation:</strong> Forces result only when two or more objects are interacting in some way. From all our examples, we can conclude that at least two objects must interact for a force to come into play.
            </div>

            <div class="definition-box">
                <strong>Complete Scientific Definition of Force:</strong><br><br>
                A force is a push or pull on an object resulting from the object's interaction with another object. The SI unit of force is newton (written with a small 'n') and its symbol is N.
            </div>

            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Examples of Two-Object Interactions:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Your foot (object 1) pushes against the ground (object 2)</li>
                    <li><strong>Writing:</strong> The pen (object 1) applies force on paper (object 2)</li>
                    <li><strong>Opening a door:</strong> Your hand (object 1) applies force on the door handle (object 2)</li>
                    <li><strong>Kicking a ball:</strong> Your foot (object 1) applies force on the ball (object 2)</li>

                <h4>🤔 A Step Further - Understanding Balanced Forces</h4>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> If an object is at rest, does it mean that no force is acting on this object?</p>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Not necessarily! It could mean that the forces acting on the object are balancing one another. For example, when a book rests on a table, gravity is pulling it down, but the table is pushing it up with equal force. These balanced forces result in no net change, so the book remains at rest. You will learn more about balanced and unbalanced forces in higher grades.</p>

                <h4>🤔 Newton's Third Law - A Preview</h4>
                <p>Here's something interesting to observe: When you push a table with your hand, do you feel a force on your hand too? The moment you stop pushing, that force on your hand disappears.</p>
                <p><strong>Important Principle:</strong> Whenever two objects interact, each object experiences a force from the other. This means forces always occur in pairs. As soon as the interaction stops, both objects no longer experience the force.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you walk, you push the ground backward, and the ground pushes you forward</li>
                    <li>When you swim, you push water backward, and water pushes you forward</li>
                    <li>When you sit on a chair, you push down on it, and it pushes up on you</li>

                <div class="definition-box">
                    <strong>Friction:</strong> The force that comes into play when an object moves or tries to move over another surface is called the force of friction, or simply friction. Friction always acts in a direction opposite to the direction in which the object is moving or trying to move. Since friction arises due to contact between two surfaces, it is a contact force.

                <h4>🔍 Why Does Friction Occur?</h4>
                <p>Friction arises due to the irregularities present in the two surfaces that are in contact. Even surfaces that appear perfectly smooth to our eyes have numerous tiny irregularities when observed under a microscope. When two surfaces are placed in contact, these irregularities interlock with each other, creating resistance to any attempt to slide one surface over the other.</p>

                <h4>📊 How Does Surface Type Affect Friction?</h4>
                <p>The amount of friction depends greatly on the nature of the surfaces in contact. Different surface combinations produce different amounts of friction.</p>

                <h3>🧲 Magnetic Force</h3>
                
                <p>You may remember learning about magnets in earlier grades. A magnet can attract objects made of iron, nickel, and cobalt (magnetic materials) without touching them. When two magnets are brought close to each other, they can either attract or repel each other depending on which poles are facing each other.</p>

                <div class="definition-box">
                    <strong>Magnetic Force:</strong> The force exerted by a magnet on another magnet or a magnetic material is called magnetic force. Since a magnet can exert force from a distance without physical contact, it is classified as a non-contact force.

                <p>An interesting demonstration of magnetic force is when you place two ring magnets on a wooden stick with like poles facing each other. The upper magnet appears to "float" in air because the magnetic force of repulsion balances the gravitational force pulling it down.</p>

                <h3>⚡ Electrostatic Force</h3>
                
                <p>Have you ever rubbed a plastic ruler with cloth and then brought it near small pieces of paper? The paper pieces jump toward the ruler as if attracted by some invisible force. This happens due to electrostatic force.</p>

                <div class="definition-box">
                    <strong>Static Charges:</strong> When two objects made of certain materials are rubbed together, electrical charges build up on their surfaces. These charges are called static charges because they do not move by themselves. An object that has acquired these static charges is said to be a charged object.
                </div>

                <p>A charged object can attract uncharged objects made of certain materials, like small pieces of paper. This attraction occurs even when the objects are not touching, making electrostatic force a non-contact force.</p>

                <h3>🌍 Gravitational Force</h3>
                
                <p>Here's a simple experiment you can try: throw a ball vertically upward. No matter how hard you throw it, it will always come back down to Earth. This happens because Earth exerts an attractive force on all objects, pulling them toward itself.</p>

                <p>Whether you drop a feather, a stone, a book, or any other object, they all fall toward the ground (though at different rates due to air resistance). This universal behavior tells us that Earth attracts all objects regardless of their size, shape, or material.</p>

                <div class="definition-box">
                    <strong>Gravitational Force:</strong> The force with which Earth attracts objects toward itself is called gravitational force. This force is also known as the force of gravity or simply gravity.

                    <strong>Key Characteristics of Gravitational Force:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Always attractive:</strong> Unlike magnetic or electrostatic forces, gravity never repels - it only attracts</li>

                        <li><strong>Non-contact force:</strong> Works without physical contact between Earth and the object</li>
                        <li><strong>Acts toward Earth's center:</strong> The force is always directed toward the center of Earth</li>

            <h2 class="section-title">5.5 Weight and Its Measurement</h2>

            <p>Now that we understand gravitational force, let's learn about a related concept that we use every day - weight. Weight is directly related to the gravitational force that Earth exerts on objects.</p>

            <div class="definition-box">
                <strong>Weight:</strong> The force with which Earth pulls an object toward itself is called the weight of the object. Weight measures how strongly an object is pulled by Earth's gravitational force.
            </div>

            <div class="formula-box">
                Since weight is a force, it is measured in the same unit as force.<br>
                <strong>SI Unit of Weight = Newton (N)</strong>
            </div>

            <h4>🤔 Does Earth Pull All Objects with Equal Force?</h4>
            <p>This is an interesting question. Let's think about it logically. If we hang different objects from a spring, we can observe how much the spring stretches for each object.</p>

            <div class="image-placeholder">

            </div>

            <p>When different objects are hung from the same spring, the spring stretches by different amounts. This tells us that Earth pulls different objects with different forces - in other words, different objects have different weights.</p>

            <div class="important-note">
                <strong>Key Observation:</strong> The stretch in the spring is directly related to the weight of the object. Heavier objects cause more stretch, while lighter objects cause less stretch.

                    <strong>Example Calculation:</strong><br>
                    If a spring balance has major marks at 0N, 1N, 2N, etc., and there are 5 small divisions between each major mark, then:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Range: 0 to 10N (assuming maximum is 10N)</li>

                        <li>Minor divisions: 5</li>
                        <li>Least count: 1N ÷ 5 = 0.2N</li>
                    </ul>
                    This means the spring balance can measure weight to the nearest 0.2N.

                    <p>In everyday life, especially for goods we commonly buy and sell, we are more interested in the amount of matter (mass) rather than the gravitational force (weight). However, people often use the term "weight" when they actually mean "mass."</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> When we say "the weight of this bag is 10 kg," we are actually referring to its mass. Scientifically, we should say "the mass of this bag is 10 kg" and "the weight of this bag is 100 N" (on Earth).</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">5.6 Floating and Sinking</h2>

            <p>Have you ever noticed that when you take water out of a bucket using a mug, the mug feels lighter when it's inside the water? Or wondered why some objects float on water while others sink to the bottom, even though gravity acts on all objects?</p>

            <div class="important-note">
                <strong>Key Question:</strong> If gravitational force acts on all objects pulling them downward, why don't all objects fall to the bottom when placed in water? What prevents some objects from sinking?
            </div>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>🌊 Buoyant Force (Upthrust)</h3>
                
                <p>When you try to push an empty plastic bottle (with lid tightly closed) into water, you can feel an upward push from the water. If you release the bottle, it bounces back to the surface. This demonstrates that water applies an upward force on objects placed in it.</p>

                <div class="definition-box">
                    <strong>Buoyant Force (Upthrust):</strong> The upward force applied by a liquid on an object placed in it is called buoyant force or upthrust. This force acts vertically upward, opposing the downward gravitational force.
                </div>

                <div class="image-placeholder">
                    <div>📷</div>
                    <div>Figure 5.15: Plastic bottle in water showing upward buoyant force</div>
                </div>

                <h4>🤔 Why Does Buoyant Force Exist?</h4>
                <p>Buoyant force exists because liquids have weight and exert pressure. When an object is placed in a liquid:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The liquid exerts pressure on all sides of the object</li>
                    <li>Pressure increases with depth</li>
                    <li>The bottom of the object experiences greater upward pressure than the top experiences downward pressure</li>
                    <li>This difference in pressure creates a net upward force - the buoyant force</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>⚖️ The Battle of Forces</h4>
                <p>When an object is placed in a liquid, two main forces act on it:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gravitational Force:</strong> Acts downward, pulling the object toward Earth's center</li>
                    <li><strong>Buoyant Force:</strong> Acts upward, pushing the object away from the liquid's bottom</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <strong>Outcome of Force Competition:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Object Sinks:</strong> When gravitational force > buoyant force</li>
                        <li><strong>Object Floats:</strong> When gravitational force = buoyant force</li>
                        <li><strong>Object Rises:</strong> When buoyant force > gravitational force (like an air bubble in water)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="step-further-box">
                    <h4>🔬 Archimedes' Principle</h4>
                    <p>Archimedes, a famous Greek scientist, discovered an important principle about buoyant force:</p>
                    <p><strong>"When an object is fully or partially immersed in a liquid, it experiences an upward force which is equal to the weight of the liquid it displaces."</strong></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Understanding Archimedes' Principle:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the weight of displaced liquid < weight of object → Object sinks</li>
                        <li>If the weight of displaced liquid = weight of object → Object floats</li>
                        <li>If the weight of displaced liquid > weight of object → Object rises to surface</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h4>📊 Factors Affecting Buoyant Force</h4>
                <p>The strength of buoyant force depends on several factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Density of the liquid:</strong> Denser liquids provide greater buoyant force</li>
                    <li><strong>Volume of object immersed:</strong> More immersion means more displaced liquid</li>
                    <li><strong>Shape of the object:</strong> Affects how much liquid is displaced</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <strong>Examples of Buoyancy in Action:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ships:</strong> Steel ships float because their hollow design displaces enough water</li>
                        <li><strong>Ice cubes:</strong> Float in water because ice is less dense than liquid water</li>
                        <li><strong>Hot air balloons:</strong> Float in air because hot air is less dense than cold air</li>
                        <li><strong>Submarines:</strong> Control buoyancy by adjusting water in ballast tanks</li>
                        <li><strong>Human body:</strong> Most people can float in water due to body's average density</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="step-further-box">
                    <h4>🪨 Floating Rocks?</h4>
                    <p><strong>Pumice Stone:</strong> Yes, some rocks can float on water! Pumice is formed during volcanic eruptions when lava with lots of gas and water vapor cools quickly. This traps tiny bubbles of gas inside, creating a light, porous rock filled with air pockets. Because of these air spaces, pumice is less dense than water and floats on it.</p>
                    <p>This shows that floating or sinking depends on density, not just the material type!</p>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>⚖️ Density and Floating</h3>
                
                <p>The key to understanding floating and sinking lies in comparing the densities of objects and liquids. Density is the amount of mass packed into a given volume.</p>

                <div class="definition-box">
                    <strong>Density Rule:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Object density < Liquid density:</strong> Object floats</li>
                        <li><strong>Object density = Liquid density:</strong> Object remains suspended</li>
                        <li><strong>Object density > Liquid density:</strong> Object sinks</li>

                <h3>✍️ Subjective Questions</h3>

                <div class="question">
                    <p><strong>1.</strong> Explain why it is difficult to walk on a wet, slippery surface. What can be done to make it safer?</p>
                    <button class="show-answer" onclick="toggleAnswer('subj1')">Show Answer</button>
                    <div class="answer" id="subj1">
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                        Walking becomes difficult on wet, slippery surfaces because friction between our shoes and the ground is greatly reduced. When surfaces are wet, a thin layer of water acts as a lubricant, reducing the contact between the irregularities of our shoe soles and the ground surface.
                        <br><br><strong>Why this happens:</strong>
                        <br>• Water fills the tiny gaps and irregularities between surfaces
                        <br>• This reduces the interlocking of surface irregularities
                        <br>• Less interlocking means less friction
                        <br>• Without adequate friction, our feet cannot grip the surface properly
                        <br><br><strong>Safety measures:</strong>
                        <br>• Use shoes with good treads or anti-slip soles
                        <br>• Walk slowly and take smaller steps
                        <br>• Use anti-slip mats or carpets
                        <br>• Add sand or salt to icy surfaces to increase roughness
                        <br>• Install handrails for support

                    <div class="answer" id="subj2">
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                        This happens because mass and weight are fundamentally different quantities:
                        <br><br><strong>Mass:</strong>
                        <br>• Represents the amount of matter in an object
                        <br>• Is an intrinsic property that doesn't change with location
                        <br>• Measured in kilograms (kg)
                        <br>• Remains constant whether on Earth, Moon, or anywhere else
                        <br><br><strong>Weight:</strong>
                        <br>• Is the gravitational force acting on an object
                        <br>• Depends on both mass and local gravitational field strength
                        <br>• Measured in Newtons (N)
                        <br>• Changes with location because gravitational strength varies
                        <br><br><strong>Moon vs Earth:</strong>
                        <br>• Moon's gravity is about 1/6th of Earth's gravity
                        <br>• Same mass experiences 1/6th the gravitational force
                        <br>• Example: 60 kg astronaut weighs 600 N on Earth but only 100 N on Moon
                        <br>• The astronaut feels lighter but still has the same amount of matter (mass)

                    <p><strong>3.</strong> Why do racing cars and airplanes have streamlined shapes? Explain in terms of forces and provide examples.</p>

                    <div class="answer" id="subj3">
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                        Racing cars and airplanes have streamlined shapes to minimize air resistance (friction with air), which allows them to move more efficiently at high speeds.
                        <br><br><strong>The Physics:</strong>
                        <br>• When objects move through air, air molecules exert friction force opposite to motion
                        <br>• This air resistance increases dramatically with speed
                        <br>• Streamlined shapes allow air to flow smoothly around the object
                        <br>• Smooth airflow reduces turbulence and drag
                        <br><br><strong>Benefits of streamlining:</strong>
                        <br>• <strong>Higher speeds:</strong> Less energy wasted fighting air resistance
                        <br>• <strong>Better fuel efficiency:</strong> Less power needed to maintain speed
                        <br>• <strong>Improved stability:</strong> Reduced turbulence means better control
                        <br>• <strong>Reduced noise:</strong> Smooth airflow is quieter
                        <br><br><strong>Examples:</strong>
                        <br>• <strong>Formula 1 cars:</strong> Pointed nose, smooth curves, low height
                        <br>• <strong>Commercial aircraft:</strong> Tapered fuselage, swept wings
                        <br>• <strong>Bullet trains:</strong> Long, pointed front end
                        <br>• <strong>Submarines:</strong> Torpedo-like shape for moving through water
                        <br>• <strong>Birds and fish:</strong> Natural streamlining for efficient movement

                        <br>   - Moon's gravity affects Earth's tides across space
                        <br>   - Magnetic fields extend beyond the visible magnet

                        <br>   - Gravity is relatively constant near Earth's surface
                        <br>   - Magnetic force varies greatly with distance and can be easily blocked by materials

                        <br>• Two north poles of magnets repel, but two masses always attract gravitationally

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                        This apparent contradiction can be explained using the concepts of density and Archimedes' principle:
                        <br><br><strong>Why an iron nail sinks:</strong>
                        <br>• Iron has a density of about 7.87 g/cm³
                        <br>• Water has a density of 1.00 g/cm³
                        <br>• Since iron density > water density, the nail sinks
                        <br>• The small nail displaces very little water, so buoyant force is small
                        <br>• Weight of nail > buoyant force, so it sinks
                        <br><br><strong>Why iron ships float:</strong>
                        <br>• Ships are not solid iron - they have a hollow structure
                        <br>• The hollow spaces contain air (density ≈ 0.001 g/cm³)
                        <br>• <strong>Average density</strong> of entire ship (iron + air) < density of water
                        <br>• Large volume displaces massive amount of water
                        <br>• Weight of displaced water = buoyant force > weight of ship
                        <br><br><strong>Key concept - Effective Density:</strong>
                        <br>• What matters is not the material density, but the average density of the entire object
                        <br>• Ship's effective density = (mass of ship) ÷ (total volume including air spaces)
                        <br>• This effective density is less than water's density
                        <br><br><strong>Design features that help:</strong>
                        <br>• Hull design maximizes internal air volume
                        <br>• Watertight compartments prevent flooding
                        <br>• Wide, flat bottom increases water displacement
